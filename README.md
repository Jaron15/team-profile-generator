# team-profile-generator
For this project I made a team profile generator. When the app is ran it will obtain information about your team and generate an html file presenting the information in an organized format.

# Features
* The app uses inquirer to ask a series of questions that will be used to fill out the necessary areas in the html.
* The questions start with who you want to add to your team, your options are Manager, Engineer, or Intern.
* Once you select what you would like to add you will be asked specific questions based on your choice.
* Once that information is put into an object the information is then taken from that object and put into the html file using the htmlGenerator function 
* The test folder has tests for every class method to make sure that they all run smoothly 
* All of the tests pass

# Installation
In order to run this application after cloning it, you will need to have node downloaded and install the packages using "npm install".
